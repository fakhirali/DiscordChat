# Discord Chat

Trying to recreate chatgpt plus in a discord server.
A chatbot is a sys prompt not an LLM. 
1 llm and n sys prompts.

Some things I want to do. 
Server members should be able to make their chatbots.
Multi chatbot text channel.
Chatbot should talk to each other.
Chatbot should itself decide when to send a message.
